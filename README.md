# Soundclout

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Then an Express server was added in the server directory. The server is proxied via the proxy key in package.json.

## Available Scripts

Run the React application on its own with the command:

### `npm start`

You can start the server on its own with the command:

### `npm server`

Run both applications together with the command:

### `npm run dev`

The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 4000.


## Soundclout Database

When you clone down this repo navigate to the server folder and copy the contents inside of Schema.txt and paste into your MySQL Workbench or whatever tool you use.
