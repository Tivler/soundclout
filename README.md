# React App With Node Server

I have made so many React Apps with Node Servers at this point, I decided to make a reusable template.

## Installation

Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

Run development server
```sh
npm run start
```

## About

This is a painfully simple app template. It only contains enough code to connect your app and server. The rest is up to your imagination.
